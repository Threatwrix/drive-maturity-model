# DRIVE Pillars (Independent of Maturity Levels)
# These categorize risks across all maturity levels
drive_pillars:
  D: "Data Protection - Data classification, encryption, retention, sharing controls"
  R: "Risk Management - Risk identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring" 
  I: "Identity Security - Authentication, authorization, access management, lifecycle"
  V: "Vulnerability Management - Security gaps, misconfigurations, exposure assessment"
  E: "Exposure Analysis - Attack surface, external access, behavioral anomalies"

# Scoring Calculation
scoring_methodology:
  base_score: "Risk assessment coverage (0-70 points)"
  policy_bonus: "Policy implementation bonus (0-20 points)" 
  control_gating: "Required controls must pass to advance levels"
  automation_multiplier: "Automation increases effectiveness scores"
  
# Maturity Level Progression
level_progression:
  principle: "Both score threshold AND required controls must be met"
  gating: "Cannot skip levels - must progress sequentially"
  measurement: "Combination of risk remediation + policy implementation + automation"
