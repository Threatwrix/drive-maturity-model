drive_pillars:
  D: "Data Protection - Data classification, encryption, retention, sharing controls"
  R: "Risk Management - Risk identification, assessment, mitigation, monitoring" 
  I: "Identity Security - Authentication, authorization, access management, lifecycle"
  V: "Vulnerability Management - Security gaps, misconfigurations, exposure assessment"
  E: "Exposure Analysis - Attack surface, external access, behavioral anomalies"

# Maturity Level Advancement (Simplified Binary Model)
advancement_model:
  principle: "Binary pass/fail for each level - ALL required checks must pass to advance"
  calculation: "Highest maturity level = highest level where ALL checks pass"
