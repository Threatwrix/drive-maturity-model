title: File System missing full control ACE
short_description: File System missing full control ACE
detailed_description: Some folders are missing a Full Control access control entry
  (ACE) for trusted administrators (e.g., BUILTIN\Administrators or NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM).
  Without that safety net, IT may be unable to reliably change permissions, evict
  bad entries, or recover ownership during incidents, backups, or migrations. If exploited,
  an attacker who gains write access can lock out admins by adding Deny ACEs, disable
  inheritance, replace the owner, and hide malicious files—turning routine remediation
  into an outage that may require offline recovery or restores. The result can be
  prolonged downtime, data loss, blocked investigations, and higher impact from ransomware
  or insider abuse.
