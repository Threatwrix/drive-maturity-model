title: File system unintended inheritance to sensitive paths
short_description: File system unintended inheritance to sensitive paths
detailed_description: Some folders automatically inherit permissions from parent folders,
  unintentionally granting access to sensitive data. If exploited, an attacker who
  gains access to a parent location can inherit read/modify rights to confidential
  files, enabling silent data theft or tampering.
