## Multi-Level Threshold Model

The ANSSI-inspired approach allows a **single 1Secure risk** to block **multiple maturity levels** at different thresholds:

### Example: External/Anonymous Sharing of Sensitive Data

```
1Secure Metric: External and Anonymous Sharing of Sensitive Data
Current Value: 12% of sensitive files

Level 1 (Critical): ‚â•15% ‚Üí PASS ‚úÖ (12% < 15%)
Level 2 (High):    ‚â•5%  ‚Üí FAIL ‚ùå (12% ‚â• 5%) ‚Üí Blocks advancement to Level 3
Level 3 (Medium):  <5%  ‚Üí Cannot evaluate (blocked at Level 2)
```

This creates **granular progression** where partial improvements still provide value even if not fully remediated.

---

## Binary Level Advancement

Organizations must pass **ALL checks** at a level to advance:

```
Overall Maturity = MIN(Data Security Level, Identity Security Level)

Example Organization:
  Data Security Domain:
    Level 1: ‚úÖ All 6 critical checks passed
    Level 2: ‚úÖ All 8 high checks passed
    Level 3: ‚ùå 2/3 baseline checks failed
    ‚Üí Data Security Level = 2

  Identity Security Domain:
    Level 1: ‚ùå 2/10 critical checks failed
    Level 2: ‚è≠Ô∏è Cannot evaluate (blocked at Level 1)
    ‚Üí Identity Security Level = 0 (Not even Level 1)

  Overall DRIVE Maturity = MIN(2, 0) = 0
```

**Key Insight:** Identity weaknesses are the primary blocker for most organizations.

## Next Steps

### For Replit Prototype Development:

1. **Review PRD** - Read `/docs/1SECURE_INTEGRATION_PRD.md` in detail
2. **Set up Replit project** - Node.js + React + TypeScript stack
3. **Configure 1Secure API** - Get credentials from QC environment
4. **Load YAML catalog** - Use `/checks/*.yaml` files as data source
5. **Build scoring engine** - Implement multi-level threshold evaluation (Section 4.3 in PRD)
6. **Create UI** - Follow wireframes in PRD Section 4.4
7. **Test with real data** - Use Gobias Industries organization

### For DRIVE Catalog Enhancement:

1. **Mark 1Secure-remediable checks** - Update YAML files with `1secure_remediable: true`
2. **Enhance remediation steps** - Add 1Secure-specific guidance to checks
3. **Validate mappings** - Review `/analysis/1secure_integration.json` for accuracy
4. **Add missing checks** - Create new YAML files for gaps (Teams, Exchange, File System)
